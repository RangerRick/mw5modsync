Mechwarrior 5 Mod Sync
======================

Welcome!

If you are reading this, you are probably one of only a handful of people.

This script syncs a curated list of Mechwarrior 5 mods with the `mods` directory of an installed version of Mechwarrior 5.

Installation
------------

1. click `Code` on this GitHub page, and select `Download ZIP`
2. unpack the downloaded ZIP file (this tool will not work if you just run things inside the ZIP file)
3. edit the `mw5-sync.ps1` file in notepad and change the `$MW5_DIR` at the top of the file to your MW5Mercs directory
4. that's it!

Running
-------

Right-click on the `do-sync.bat` file and run it as an administrator.

(This is necessary to avoid issues with running powershell scripts without changing how your system handles script permissions.)
